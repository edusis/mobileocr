<b>The project is currently on hold and only tested on Droid devices, but if you are interested in helping, let us know!</b>

Our team is working on a project called Mobile OCR (Mobile Optical Character Recognition). If you would like to try it out, you can download the 'MobileOCR_2.0' apk file in the source tab. This should work for phones with Android 2.0 and above.<br>

<br>
The goal of Mobile OCR is to create an application for the Android platform that will recognize text from an image taken by the phoneâ€™s camera. The application will be fully accessible to low vision and blind users.<br>
<br>
As of right now, Mobile OCR does not support on-board OCR, only network OCR. It is also very picky on what text it reads. For better OCR results, here are some tips:<br>
<ul><li>Images have to be in portrait mode (i.e. when the phone is on its side).<br>
</li><li>The text has to be black and non-handwritten on white paper.<br>
</li><li>There can't be shadows on the image.<br>
</li><li>Non-text pictures can't be in the image.<br>
</li><li>The lines of text have to parallel to the camera.<br>
